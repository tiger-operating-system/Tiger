# Tiger
The Full Tiger Operating System

Initiating this OS is a full project. Please prepare yourself.
To start up this operating system, you must first download all of the code to a usb flash drive.
Then you will boot up this flash drive and the Tiger system will load. You will then see a logo that says: Tiger.
Once the menu loads, please select download to your machine and proceed.
Once it downloads, select dual boot alongside your current OS or replace it. It's your choice.
You should be all set to go after that!
